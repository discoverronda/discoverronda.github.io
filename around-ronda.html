    <h3>BENAJOAN</h3>

    <p>My favorite activity to look forward to is always when I can get on
      the train and go travelling - my holidays, weekends and every amount
      of time away from work were always the times I was looking forward to
      the most. They were like those treats for me for which I was always
      looking forward to and couldn’t wait to start. It may not have very rational or logical answers to it - it just feels right
      and every time it happens it makes my hearts grow and I come back from
      every trip feeling a little bit better with more knowledge and with
      more love and appreciation for the world. I am the type of traveller
      who likes to wander, learn and also relax during a trip.</p>
