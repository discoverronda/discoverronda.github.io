        <h2>Why I Travel:</h2>
        <p>
          My favorite activity to look forward to is always when I can get on
          the train and go travelling - my holidays, weekends and every amount
          of time away from work were always the times I was looking forward to
          the most. They were like those treats for me for which I was always
          looking forward to and couldn’t wait to start. Why? Unfortunately I do
          not have very rational or logical answers to it - it just feels right
          and every time it happens it makes my hearts grow and I come back from
          every trip feeling a little bit better with more knowledge and with
          more love and appreciation for the world. I am the type of traveller
          who likes to wander, learn and also relax during a trip.
        </p>
        <p>
          My favorite places to visit are smaller towns where I can explore
          streets or just relax in a coffee shop, order something small and
          enjoy watching the world goes by. I also enjoy spending time close to
          nature, walking in forests, hiking, visiting national parks or just
          finding new places and following where the map takes me. I enjoy new
          places or countries from time to time but at the same time I also
          enjoy coming back to the same places I visited before. It is enjoyable
          and educational seeing how they change over a time. They become more
          like my other homes which I get to understand better with every minute
          spent there.

        <h2>Accommodation I choose:</h2>

        <p>
          As my travels are my treats, I was always trying to choose the right
          accommodation which fits perfectly with what I need. Due to money
          constraints I usually compromised on some things I was looking for in
          accommodation but over time I decided that since it is my treat time I
          want it to be as free from concerns as possible so I started to look
          for more expensive accommodation hoping that it will tick all the
          boxes and at the same time I tried to save on other things.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don’t mind paying more for accommodation if I know it will provide
          what I need but unfortunately over time I noticed that it is not
          actually always happening. Not always but unfortunately quite often I
          came back from my trips with a few disappointing memories of my
          accommodation. These were not a big things, these were actually very
          easily avoidable or fixable issues but unfortunately either my
          requests were forgotten or badly handled or even sometimes just
          ignored.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would usually spend a good deal of time on choosing the right
          accommodation as it was a place where I would not only like to come
          back and have a good nights sleep but also relax while drinking a cup
          of tea or just sitting on the terrace or just popping in for a break
          from my sightseeing for a few minutes and relaxing before getting back
          to my adventures.

        <h2>My dream B & B:</h2>
        <p>
          It was not easy for me to find an accommodation that would tick all
          the boxes, I was ready to pay more but at the same I would not like it
          to ruin me financially. So I was always saying that some day I will
          create my own B&B where I can offer the type of service that I have
          been always looking for. Additionally, I has been working for many
          years in different hotels learning how to provide best guest service
          possible...and that’s how it all started...
