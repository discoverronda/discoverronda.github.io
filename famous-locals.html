      <h5>Abul Beka</h5>
<p>Abul Beka was one of the most celebrated poets of the Moors in Andalusia. He was born in Ronda and also studied there.

<p> Abad Ibn Firnas was a proto-humanist, scientist and Andalusian chemist born in Ronda. In 852 he was said to have attempted the first flight (600 years before Leonardo Da Vinci), throwing himself from a tower in Córdoba with a huge canvas to cushion the fall. Luckily he only suffered minor injuries, with this flight resulting in him being considered the creator of the first parachute. He had many inventions, such as an armillary sphere to represent the movement of the stars, development of a rock crystal carving technique and being the first to use the Sinhind astronomical tables in the Iberian peninsula, this led to the development of later European science. 
  A statue of Abad Ibn Firnas was built near the Baghdad Airport in Iraq, while a crater on the moon and a bridge in Cordoba are named after him.
