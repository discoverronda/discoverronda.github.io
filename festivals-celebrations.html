        Week of religious acts, concerts, liturgies, a walk of thrones and images through the streets of Ronda. Sponsored by the Brotherhoods and Brotherhoods of Ronda.<br><br>
        Like all Andalucian towns, Ronda celebrates Holy Week with processions, most of which begin in the late afternoon and take hours to wend through the streets and alleys of the old city. Due to its historic charm Ronda is an excelent place to watch the proscssions. Many cross the Tajo at puente nuevo into Plaza Espana. The Baclcony of the rooms of the Parador are an excxcelent place to watch these processions. The Legionairs procession on the night of Jueves Santo and the Widows on Viernes Santo are highlights of Ronda Semana Santa.          </p>

            <h3>Ronda Romántica</h3>
            <p>Ronda is known to be one of the oldest towns in Spain, with remains from prehistoric settlements of the Neolithic period evident in the cave paintings of the nearby 'Cueva de la Pileta'. 
            The Celts were the first settlers of Ronda in the 6th Century B.C., giving the town its original name of Arunda. The now-ruins of the nearby Acinipo (land of the wines) was later founded by the Phoenicians. In the Second Century B.C. the Romans came to Ronda and were engaged in bloody wars with the Carthaginians. After the defeat of the Carthaginians in the Second Punic War, the Romanisation of Acinipo in particular led to a period in which it was developed into a major municipality and had such importance that coins could be minted there. Ronda itself had been a fortified post for the Romans during the Second Punic War and it too developed as a municipality. Periods of peace, unrest and invasion followed for both towns with the eventual decline of the Roman Empire leading to the pillaging and destruction of both towns. Acinipo was eventually abandoned by the 6th century while Ronda however would be entering a period of great prosperity with the arrival of the Moors.
