      <h2>Why I Travel:</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to Guide to Malaga, a tourist information site run by me, Joanna Styles. I’ve lived in Malaga and the
        Costa del Sol for over 30 years and during that time, have discovered a true passion for Malaga. On this page,
        you’ll find out how Guide to Malaga all began; read about our milestones; discover why this guide is different;
        learn about our values; and find out how Guide to Malaga can help you if you’re a tourist or a business.

        My favorite activity to look forward to is always when I can get on
        the train and go travelling - my holidays, weekends and every amount
        of time away from work were always the times I was looking forward to
        the most. They were like those treats for me for which I was always
        looking forward to and couldn’t wait to start. Why? Unfortunately I do
        not have very rational or logical answers to it - it just feels right
        and every time it happens it makes my hearts grow and I come back from
        every trip feeling a little bit better with more knowledge and with
        more love and appreciation for the world. I am the type of traveller
        who likes to wander, learn and also relax during a trip.

        the most. They were like those treats for me for which I was always
        looking forward to and couldn’t wait to start. It may not have very rational or logical answers to it - it just
        feels right
